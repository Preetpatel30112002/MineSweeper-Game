Minesweeper Game
This is a Python implementation of the classic Minesweeper game, where players attempt to clear a grid of hidden mines without detonating any. The game is played on a 10x10 board, with a random distribution of 10 bombs. The player can either "dig" to uncover a cell or "flag" a cell that they suspect contains a bomb. The game ends when all non-bomb cells are uncovered, or when the player digs a bomb.

How to Play
Board Setup:

The game board consists of a 10x10 grid, where each cell is either empty, contains a bomb (*), or displays a number representing the count of bombs in adjacent cells.
The playerâ€™s goal is to uncover all cells without triggering a bomb.
User Actions:

The player inputs coordinates to either dig or flag a cell.
To dig a cell, enter the coordinates in the format row,column (e.g., 1,1).
To flag a cell (suspected of containing a bomb), add an f after the coordinates (e.g., 1,1f).
Game Rules:

If a cell with a bomb is dug, the game is over.
If a cell with no surrounding bombs (0) is dug, all neighboring cells are automatically uncovered.
The game is won when all non-bomb cells are uncovered.
Game End:

The game ends when the player hits a bomb or successfully uncovers all safe cells.
After the game ends, the player has the option to replay.
